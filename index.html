<h2>Universal's Islands of Adventure</h2>
<p>Universal's Islands of Adventure (also known as Islands of Adventure or IOA), originally called Universal Studios Islands of Adventure, is a theme park located in Orlando, Florida.</p>

<p>It opened on May 28, 1999, along with CityWalk, as part of an expansion that converted Universal Studios Florida into the Universal Orlando Resort. The resort's slogan Vacation Like You Mean It was introduced in 2013.</p>

<p>Islands of Adventure is modeled after a journey of exploration, where guests embark on an adventure to visit a variety of themed islands. Initially, the park featured six islands. A seventh, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, was added in 2010, themed to the highly successful Harry Potter franchise.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Before Islands of Adventure was built, the site was originally planned as a shopping mall called Galleria Orlando.Plans were first drawn up for the mall in 1985, but it was ultimately canceled in 1990,the same year Universal Studios Florida opened next door.</p>
<h2>Marvel Super Hero Island</h2>
<p>Marvel Super Hero Island is based on the superhero characters featured in Marvel Comics. The area features comic-book styled architecture; many of the building interiors are created in comic book perspective, with exaggerated lines and angles. Many exteriors are painted in a special paint which appears to change color based on the angle from which it is viewed – sometimes purple, sometimes orange.</p>
